                    <h3>MADEA GETS A JOB</h3>
					<p>Hard times (and the judge) caught up with Madea and she is forced to come out of retirement to go to work. Remember, since she is still on probation, Madea is not a star candidate for employment. A job at a nursing home would make Madea's employer never be the same after one day.</p>
					<p><b>ACTORS<p></b> 
					<p> It stars Tyler Perry as Madea, Chandra Currelley as Barbra, Patrice Lovely as Hattie and Cheryl Pepsii Riley as Carla.</p>
